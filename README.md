# ajax-notes
Code examples of Ajax requests in jQuery, vanilla JS (fetch), and XHR to use for future reference.

Notes:

-Minimize the number of Ajax requests
    -try to get all you can in the smallest amount of requests

- Prefer GET over POST requests
    -GET can work faster

-Reduce Data Size as much as you can
    - Plain text < JSON < YAML < XML
